## graph database

> A graph database (GDB) is a database that uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data.
> A key concept of the system is the graph (or edge or relationship). The graph relates the data items in the store to a collection of nodes and edges, the edges representing the relationships between the nodes.
