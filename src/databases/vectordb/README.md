> Consider a query q, and suppose the algorithm outputs a set X of k candidate near neighbors, and suppose G is
> the ground-truth set of the k closest neighbors to q from among the points of the base dataset. Then, we define the k-recall@k
> of this set X to be **|Xâˆ©G| / k**.

> The goal of an ANN algorithm then is to **maximize recall** while retrieving the results as quickly as possible, which results in the **recall-vs-latency tradeoff**.
